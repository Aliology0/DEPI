1. What’s the difference between full, differential and transactional back up?

-A full backup is a complete copy of the entire database at a point in time
 including all the data, objects, and transaction log records.

-A differential backup only saves the changes made since the last full backup
 not since the last differential one.

-A transaction log backup captures all the changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
 made to the database since the last log backup.

4. What is trigger and why use it and on what level and what makes it different from normal Stord procedure

without needing the developer to manually call anything.
