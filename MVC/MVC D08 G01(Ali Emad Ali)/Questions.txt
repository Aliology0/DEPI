4) Handling Security Issues in Connection Strings

Storing a connection string directly in code is risky because it exposes sensitive
information such as database credentials. There are several secure approaches to
avoid hard-coding this data.
(1) Store the connection string inside the appsettings.json file and read it
using configuration binding.
(2) Use Environment Variables so credentials are loaded from the server
environment at runtime.
(3) Use Secret Managers or Azure Key Vault to securely store and retrieve
connection strings or keys during development and deployment. These methods help
protect confidential information

5) AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used in web
applications to send and receive data from the server asynchronously
without reloading the entire page. It allows for smoother and faster
interactions, enhancing the user experience. In MVC applications, AJAX
is often used to update specific parts of a webpage dynamically based on
user actions.

Three main reasons to use AJAX in MVC apps are:
1- It improves performance by avoiding full page reloads.
2- It reduces server load by sending and receiving only required data.
3- It enhances user experience with faster and more responsive updates.

Simple Demo:
When a user selects a student from a dropdown list, AJAX sends the
student ID to the server and returns the corresponding details, updating
only that part of the page without refreshing the entire view.
