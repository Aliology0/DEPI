Multithreading programming is a concept that allows a program to perform multiple
tasks at the same time. Instead of running one operation after another, it divides the
work into smaller threads that run concurrently. This helps improve performance and
responsiveness, especially in applications that handle heavy tasks like database access,
file processing, or complex calculations. For example, in a web server, multithreading
allows multiple users to be served simultaneously without waiting for each other’s
requests to complete.
