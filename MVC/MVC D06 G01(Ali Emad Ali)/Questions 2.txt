Why we need architecture in any project:
Architecture provides structure and organization to a project,
ensuring scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.
It helps developers manage complexity, improve code reusability, and make
future changes or enhancements easier.

What is N-Tier architecture:
N-Tier (or multilayer) architecture divides an application into layers such as
Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access. Each layer has its own responsibility,
making the system more organized, secure, and easier to maintain or test.
================================================================================================
What is Onion architecture:
Onion architecture focuses on keeping business logic at the core,
independent of external systems like databases or UI. It uses layers
that depend inwardly, promoting loose coupling and testability.
The idea is to isolate the application core from external concerns.

Is LINQ slow in execution?
LINQ itself isn’t slow; performance depends on how it’s used.
The key to understanding LINQ’s speed is knowing the difference
between deferred execution (query runs only when results are iterated)
and eager execution (query runs immediately). Inefficient use of deferred
queries can lead to repeated database calls and slower performance.
