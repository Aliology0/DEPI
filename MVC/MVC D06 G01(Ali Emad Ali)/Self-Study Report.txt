1. Custom Attributes in Client-Side Validation

In ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET Core MVC, custom validation attributes handle
server-side checks by default but don’t automatically support client-side
validation through jQuery Unobtrusive Validation. To make them work on the
client side, developers can implement the IClientValidatable interface, which
allows generating data-val-* attributes automatically in the rendered HTML.
This provides immediate feedback to users without waiting for a postback.
Alternatively, developers can manually inject validation attributes using custom
Tag Helpers or implement validation entirely with JavaScript and AJAX. However,
the recommended approach is using IClientValidatable for consistency and
better integration with MVC’s validation pipeline.

2. Three Cases of Using Custom Middleware

Custom middleware in ASP.NET Core is used to handle cross-cutting concerns
within the request pipeline.

Request Logging and Diagnostics: Middleware can capture and log details
about each request and response, such as URLs, headers, and processing time,
which helps in monitoring and debugging.

Authentication and Authorization: Middleware can intercept requests to
verify tokens, credentials, or user roles before they reach controllers, ensuring
that only authorized users access protected resources.

Exception Handling: Middleware can catch unhandled exceptions, log them,
and return user-friendly error responses, improving the application’s stability.
Overall, custom middleware simplifies maintaining centralized logic for common
tasks like logging, security, and error handling.

3. New Features in .NET 9 for Generic Types

.NET 9 introduces several enhancements that make working with generic types
more powerful and efficient. Developers can now use ref struct types as
generic parameters, enabling high-performance, stack-only operations. New
LINQ methods, such as CountBy and AggregateBy, provide more optimized
ways to group and aggregate data. The framework also adds new generic
collections, including OrderedDictionary<TKey, TValue> for ordered key-value
storage, and ReadOnlySet<T> for immutable set operations. These improvements
enhance type safety, performance, and flexibility in generic programming within
.NET 9.
