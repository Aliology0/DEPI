1) Inline Initialization & Constructor Initialization
Inline initialization means assigning default values to class fields or properties
directly where they are declared. It makes code shorter and more readable by
showing default values near the variable definitions. Constructor initialization
happens inside a class constructor, where parameters are used to assign values
to fields when an object is created. Inline initialization is useful for constants
and default values, while constructor initialization is better when values must
be provided dynamically at object creation.

2) Abstraction Layer
An abstraction layer hides implementation details and exposes only the essential
features to other parts of the system. It allows developers to work with
high-level concepts rather than low-level logic. In software architecture, an
abstraction layer improves maintainability and flexibility because components
can be modified or replaced without affecting others. For example, in an
N-tier application, the service or interface layer acts as an abstraction between
the UI and data layers.

3) Repository Pattern
The repository pattern separates data access logic from business logic by
providing a consistent way to query and manipulate data. Instead of working
directly with the database or Entity Framework context, code interacts with a
repository interface. This makes the application easier to test, maintain, and
extend. It also promotes loose coupling and cleaner architecture, since the
data source can be changed with minimal impact on higher layers.
