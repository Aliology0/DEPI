I chose Blink22, Fawry, and Egypt Software as my three target software houses in Egypt.
===========================================================================================
I selected Blink22 because it is a fast-growing software house known for
building high-quality web and mobile applications for international clients using
modern technologies like .NET, React, and Node.js. This would give me a chance to
work in an agile, innovation-driven environment and improve my full-stack
development skills.
===========================================================================================
Fawry is one of Egyptâ€™s biggest fintech leaders, offering large-scale and secure
payment solutions that serve millions of users daily. Working there would allow me
to experience enterprise-level development, database optimization, and
performance-driven systems with real-world financial impact.
===========================================================================================
Finally, Egypt Software focuses on business and accounting solutions tailored to
the Egyptian market, providing an excellent opportunity to understand local
business needs and apply practical knowledge in software design and
implementation.
