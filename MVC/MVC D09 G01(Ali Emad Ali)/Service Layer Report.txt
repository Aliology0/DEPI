The Service Layer is an important architectural layer that sits between the
Controller and the Repository Layer. Its main purpose is to handle the
business logic of the application, the rules, validations, and processes that
define how data should be managed and used.

While the Repository Layer focuses only on data access (CRUD operations),
the Service Layer focuses on application logic, deciding when and how
to use the repository methods. This ensures that your code follows the
Separation of Concerns principle, keeping each layer responsible for a specific
task.

For example, instead of writing business rules inside a controller, you can create
a StudentService class that validates the student’s age, checks for duplicates,
and then calls _studentRepository.Add(student) only if the rules are satisfied.
This makes your controller cleaner and your business logic reusable.

The main advantages of using a Service Layer include:

1. Better Organization –> Keeps controllers simple and focused on UI logic.
2. Easier Testing –> You can test business logic separately from database logic.
3. Reusability –> The same service methods can be used across multiple controllers.

By combining the Service Layer with the Repository Pattern, you achieve a
clean and professional architecture that separates responsibilities, increases
testability, and keeps your application logic easy to manage.
