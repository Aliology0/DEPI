1) CDN

A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a system of servers located
in different regions that deliver static files like CSS, JS, and
images. Using a CDN makes websites faster because users download
files from the nearest server instead of the hosting server only.

2) min (minified)

Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters from
source code without changing its functionality. This includes spaces,
line breaks, tabs, and comments. For example, a normal JavaScript
file may be 200 KB, while the .min.js version could be only 70 KB.
Browsers download the smaller file faster, which improves performance.
Developers usually keep both normal and minified versions: the normal
file is easier to read during coding, while the minified one is used
in production for efficiency.

3) bundle

Bundling is the practice of combining multiple CSS or JavaScript
files into one single file. Instead of the browser making 10 or 20
requests for each file, it only makes one. This reduces the number
of HTTP requests and improves page load speed. In older ASP.NET MVC,
bundling and minification were done automatically with the
System.Web.Optimization library. In modern ASP.NET Core, developers
use tools like Webpack, Gulp, or built-in middleware to manage
bundling and minification.

4) Class modelstatedictionary

ModelStateDictionary is an ASP.NET Core class that stores the
results of model binding and validation for an HTTP request. When
a form is submitted, the Model Binder tries to map incoming values
to your model properties. If the user forgets to fill a required
field or enters invalid data, errors are recorded inside ModelState.
In controllers, we usually write if (!ModelState.IsValid) to check
if the model is valid before saving it to the database. It also
allows us to access specific error messages and display them in the
view next to form fields.
