1) Up to new Change Vs Up to previous Change

In Entity Framework Core, the best practice is to always create a new migration for any schema change,
even if you later revert it. For example, renaming a property from Name to EmpName and then back to Name
should result in two separate migrations. This preserves a clear history of database changes, avoids conflicts
with existing databases, and ensures consistency in team or production environments. Editing old migrations is
discouraged, as it can break synchronization and reduce maintainability.
