What is record in C#, and how is it related to DTOs?

A record in C# is a special type introduced to simplify the
creation of objects that mainly store data without requiring a
lot of boilerplate code. Records are immutable by default,
meaning once created their values cannot be changed, which
makes them very suitable for representing data that is only
passed around and not modified. This fits well with the
concept of a Data Transfer Object, because DTOs are usually
used only to carry data between layers of an application
without containing business logic. Using a record for a DTO
reduces code, improves readability, and naturally enforces the
idea that DTOs should not change after creation.

What is a tuple in C#, and how is it related to data structures?

A tuple in C# is a lightweight data structure that can hold
multiple values of different types without needing to define a
full class or record. Tuples are useful for returning more
than one value from a method, grouping temporary data, or
quickly combining values in memory. Their relationship to data
structures is that they offer a simple way to store structured
data but are not usually used as permanent domain objects.
Tuples provide quick and flexible data grouping, while more
formal data structures such as classes, records, and structs
provide better long-term organization and clarity.
