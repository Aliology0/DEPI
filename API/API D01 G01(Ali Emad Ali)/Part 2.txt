1. What, When and Why API Versioning?
API versioning is the practice of managing changes in an
API without disrupting existing users. It allows developers
to release new features, fix bugs, or restructure data
formats while keeping backward compatibility. Versioning
is used when major changes occur — for example, altering
response structures or removing endpoints. It ensures that
clients using old versions can still function smoothly while
new clients benefit from improvements. Common approaches
include using the URL path (e.g., /v1/), request headers, or
query parameters. The main reason for versioning is to
provide stability, predictability, and flexibility for API
consumers while allowing the API to evolve over time.

2. What are REST Principles?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural
style for designing networked applications. It relies on
stateless communication between client and server, usually
using HTTP. The key principles include:
1. Statelessness: Each request must contain all the
information needed to process it.
2. Client-Server Separation: The client and server work
independently, enabling scalability and modularity.
3. Uniform Interface: Resources are accessed through
standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
4. Cacheability: Responses can be cached to improve
performance.
5. Layered System: APIs can be built in layers for
security and scalability.
6. Code on Demand (optional): Servers can send
executable code to clients when needed.
Together, these principles make RESTful APIs reliable,
scalable, and easy to maintain.

3. What are REST Naming Conventions?
REST naming conventions make APIs consistent, readable,
and predictable. Best practices include:
- Use nouns, not verbs, for resource names
  (e.g., /users, not /getUsers).
- Use plural nouns for collections
  (e.g., /products, /orders).
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens for readability
  (e.g., /user-profiles).
- Use path hierarchy to show relationships
  (e.g., /users/123/orders).
- Avoid file extensions in URLs (e.g., no .json or .xml).
- Keep URLs simple and descriptive to improve usability.
Following these conventions helps maintain uniformity and
makes APIs easier to understand and integrate with.

4. What, When and Why Rate Limiting?
Rate limiting is a technique used to control the number of
requests a client can make to an API within a certain time
frame. It prevents abuse, server overload, and denial of
service attacks. Rate limiting is implemented when an API
is public, high-traffic, or performance-sensitive. It helps
ensure fair usage among all clients and protects resources
from being exhausted by excessive requests. Common methods
include fixed window, sliding window, and token bucket
algorithms. The main reasons for rate limiting are to
enhance security, maintain performance, and ensure a
reliable experience for all API users.
