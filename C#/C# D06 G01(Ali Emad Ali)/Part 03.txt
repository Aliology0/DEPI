1) Can Constructor be private?

A constructor can be private, for it is when you want to restrict object creation so that only the class itself can control how and when instances are made.

Singleton Pattern (most famous case)

Goal: Allow only one instance of a class in the whole application.

Example:

public class DatabaseConnectionManager
{
    private static DatabaseConnectionManager _instance;
    private DatabaseConnectionManager() { } // private constructor

    public static DatabaseConnectionManager GetInstance()
    {
        if (_instance == null)
            _instance = new DatabaseConnectionManager();
        return _instance;
    }
}

2) BCL >> Override tostring()


ToString() is a virtual method in System.Object (which is part of the BCL).
Every class in C# inherits ToString().
By default, it returns the classâ€™s fully qualified name ("Namespace.ClassName").
Override it when you want a meaningful text representation of your object.

public class Employee
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"Employee: {Name}, Age: {Age}";
    }
}

Employee emp = new Employee { Name = "Ali", Age = 25 };	
Console.WriteLine(emp.ToString()); // Output: Employee: Ali, Age: 25
==========================================================================================================================
3) struct : u can't create less ctor in struct in .net 5 >> .net 6.0 or greater >> why ?

In .NET 5 and earlier, structs were very restricted in how constructors worked:

You could not declare your own parameterless (default) constructor.
The compiler always auto-generated a hidden default constructor that simply zero-initialized all fields.
This was done to keep structs blazingly fast and blittable (safe to copy directly in memory without custom init logic).


The primary reason for allowing explicit parameterless constructors in structs in 
C# 10 (and .NET 6) was to enable field initializers for structs. Before this change,
if a struct had fields with initializers, a compilation error would occur
because there was no way to ensure these initializers were run when the struct was created using new StructName().

By allowing explicit parameterless constructors, the language now provides a mechanism to:

Execute field initializers:
When an explicit parameterless constructor is defined, it can ensure that any field initializers
declared in the struct are executed during the construction process.

Provide custom default initialization logic:
Developers can now define custom logic within the parameterless constructor to initialize struct fields
to values other than their default zero-initialized state, providing more control over the struct's initial state.
