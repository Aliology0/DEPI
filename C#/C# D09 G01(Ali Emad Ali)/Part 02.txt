2- What we mean by Generalization concept using Generics ?

Generalization with Generics means writing code that works with different data types without duplicating logic.
Instead of creating multiple versions of a method/class for int, string, double, etc., you use a type parameter (T)
so the same implementation can handle any type safely while still being type-safe at compile time.

3- What we mean by hierarchy design in real business ?

Hierarchy design in business means structuring classes (or entities) in levels of inheritance
that reflect real-world relationships.

Base classes represent general concepts (e.g., Employee).
Derived classes represent more specific roles (e.g., Manager, Engineer).

This hierarchy makes systems easier to extend, maintain, and understand, because they model real-world roles
and responsibilities.
