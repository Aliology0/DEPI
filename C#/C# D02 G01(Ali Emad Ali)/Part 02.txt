what's the difference between compiled and interpreted languages and in this way what about Csharp?

The fundamental difference between compiled and interpreted languages lies in how their
source code is translated and executed by a computer.

Compiled Languages:
- Source code is translated into machine-readable code (executable file) by a compiler before execution.

- This translation process, known as compilation, occurs once.

- The resulting executable can then be run directly by the operating system without needing the original source code or a separate translation program.

- Examples: C, C++, and Rust.


Interpreted Languages:
- Source code is translated and executed line by line at runtime by an interpreter.

- The interpreter reads and translates each instruction as the program runs.

- This means the source code or a form of it is needed every time the program is executed.

- Examples: Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.

Compare between implicit, explicit, Convert and parse casting

Implicit:
Used when converting from a smaller to a larger or compatible data type (int to double).
It happens automatically without needing any extra code because there's no risk of data loss.

Explicit:
Used when converting from a larger or incompatible type to a smaller type (double to int).
You must manually specify the conversion using a cast, and thereâ€™s a risk of data loss or runtime errors.

Convert:
Uses the Convert class (Convert.ToInt32) to safely convert between types, including from strings or objects.
It handles null values gracefully in many cases and is more flexible than simple casting.

Parse:
Used to convert a string to a value type (int.Parse("123")).
It throws an exception if the string is null, empty, or in the wrong format,
so it should only be used when the input is guaranteed to be valid.
