5- what meant by Csharp is managed code

To put it simply, managed code is just that: code whose execution is managed by a runtime.
In this case, the runtime in question is called the Common Language Runtime or CLR,
regardless of the implementation (for example, Mono, .NET Framework, or .NET Core/.NET 5+).
The CLR is in charge of taking the managed code, compiling it into machine code and then executing it.
On top of that, the runtime provides several important services such as automatic memory management,
security boundaries, and type safety.

6- what meant by struct is considered like class before

Becuase both can have:

- Fields
- Properties
- Methods
- Constructors (with parameters)
- Interfaces (they can implement interfaces)
- Both are defined similarly
