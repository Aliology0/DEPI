Parallel Programming vs. Concurrency

Parallel programming splits tasks into sub-tasks that run simultaneously on multiple CPU cores.
Concurrency allows multiple tasks to be in progress during overlapping time periods, but not necessarily executing at the same instant.
Concurrency is about handling many things at once, while parallelism is about doing many things at once.

Unit Testing & Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Unit testing verifies small, isolated parts of code to ensure they work correctly.
It helps detect regressions early and serves as documentation for code behavior.

TDD means writing a failing test first, then writing code to pass it, and finally refactoring.
This process improves design, keeps code decoupled, and increases reliability.

Asynchronous Programming with async and await

The {async} and {await} keywords simplify asynchronous programming in C#.
They let you write code that looks sequential but runs asynchronously.
This keeps applications responsive and prevents blocking during long-running or I/O-bound operations.
Async/await makes code more readable and easier to maintain compared to callbacks.
